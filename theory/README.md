# Models of Computation

> A model of computation (computation model) (or computational formalism) is a formal system that defines how computations are represented and executed. How is this process represented? And what are the semantics of this representation?

> The universe writes itself into existence one step at a time, like a computation unfolding.
Just as a program is an underlying rule that drives the computation, the laws of nature act as the underlying rules that drive the unfolding of the universe. In both cases, the process builds itself incrementally, step by step, from within.

> A **computation** writes into existence one step at a time; state and state change; driven by the underlying rule (the program).

> Computation (Program)  = Universe (Laws of Physics).

> Model of Computation:  Process Space â†’ Representation Space.

> In this section we try to explore a set of models of computation.

## Key Guiding Questions

- Within which model of computation can a given process be described most simply?
- What concepts and constructs do different models of computation provide to express processes?

## Concepts

- Data
- Time
- State
- Function
- Recursion
- Evaluation
