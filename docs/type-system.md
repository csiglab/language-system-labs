# Type Systems

- Dependent Types – Study languages like Idris, Agda, or Coq to explore how types can encode proofs.
- Gradual Typing – Investigate the combination of static and dynamic typing (e.g., TypeScript, Python's mypy).
- Refinement Types – Study languages like Liquid Haskell to see how types can encode constraints for safer code.
