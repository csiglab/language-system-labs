# ☕ Java

> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for platform independence. It enables developers to write code once and run it anywhere a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is available.

> 🧪 This space collects small scripts and programs to explore key areas of the language.

## 🧭 Areas of Study (Unordered)

Focus on the following technical dimensions:

* 🧠 **Semantics** – meaning and behavior of language constructs
* ⚡ **Performance** – runtime efficiency and optimization
* 🧬 **Type System** – static vs dynamic typing, generics, nullability
* 🧮 **Memory Model** – heap, stack, garbage collection, memory consistency
* 🔗 **Interoperability** – integration with other languages (e.g., JNI, Kotlin)
* 🏃‍♂️ **Runtime System** – class loading, bytecode execution, JIT compilation
* 🧩 **Code Resolution** – linking, method resolution, classpath behavior
* 🛠️ **Instrumentation** – profiling, monitoring, bytecode manipulation
* 🖥️ **Execution Model** – the JVM as an abstract machine
* 🔁 **Control Flow Models** – exceptions, loops, async flows
* 🎯 **Language-Specific Features**:

  * 🛤️ **Compiler APIs** – programmatic interaction with Java compilers
  * 🧰 **JVM APIs** – tools for interacting with the virtual machine at runtime
