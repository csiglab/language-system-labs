# Scheme

> Scheme is a statically scoped, homoiconic, expression-oriented functional language defined by a small axiomatic core and extended via hygienic macros, featuring first-class procedures, call/cc-based delimited control, proper tail-call optimization, uniform s-expression syntax, and an operational semantics based on applicative-order Î»-calculus with full continuations and a precise formal specification via denotational semantics.
